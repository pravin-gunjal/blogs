Most teams predominantly use various distributed Version Control Systems for their code management. However, VCS is not only about code management and versioning of your application. It is more about workflow management and collaboration with your team members, stakeholders, and clients.

Implementing the best approach at the initial level will make your development, deployments, and CI/CD operations smoother and more efficient. Properly leveraging version control can enhance team productivity, streamline collaboration, and ensure a reliable and scalable development process.

Also, share your view about different approaches for VCS branching which will be more helpful.
